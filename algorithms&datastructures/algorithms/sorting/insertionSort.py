# Insertion Sort
# Partitions the array into sorted and unsorted sub-arrays. 
# It selects the first element in the unsorted sub-array and shuffles the sorted elements 
# left until the correct insertion index is found.
# The insertion index is found looking right to left from the sorted array.
# This approach is an efficient solution for partially sorted arrays and small datasets. 
# In practice, it is a more efficient sorting algorithm than other O(nÂ²) algorithms 
# (e.g. Selection Sort and Bubble Sort). Think of Insertion Sort as how people naturally sort a hand of cards.
# Average Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
